# Origin-Tea: Lightweight and Generalizable Model for Tea Provenance Identification

> 🚧 **This repository is under preparation. Code and data will be released upon paper acceptance. Stay tuned!**

## 📌 Overview

This repository will contain the source code, pretrained models, and datasets associated with our paper:

**"Origin-Tea: A Lightweight Model for Tea Geographical Origin Recognition Based on Phenotypic Features"**  
*(Submitted to [Nature Communication], under review)*

We propose **Origin-Tea**, a compact and high-performance neural network designed for classifying the geographic origin of tea leaves. The model is tailored to handle diverse image acquisition modalities, including both camera and scanner-based data.
