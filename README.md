# Origin-Tea: A Lightweight Model for Tea Geographical Origin Recognition Based on Phenotypic Features

> ðŸš§ **This repository is under preparation. Code and data will be released upon paper acceptance. Stay tuned!**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository will contain the source code, pretrained models, and datasets associated with our paper:

**"Origin-Tea: A Lightweight Model for Tea Geographical Origin Recognition Based on Phenotypic Features"**  
*(Submitted to [Nature Communication], under review)*

We propose **Origin-Tea**, a compact and high-performance neural network designed for classifying the geographic origin of tea leaves.
