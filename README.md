## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the source code, pretrained models, and datasets associated with our paper:

**"Phenotypic Feature-Based Identification of Tea Geographical Origin Using Lightweight Deep Learning"** *Published in npj Science of Food (2026)*

We propose **Origin-Tea**, a compact and high-performance neural network designed for classifying the geographic origin of tea leaves.

**Note on Data Availability**: Due to requirements for subsequent research, only 30% of the dataset is currently open-sourced.
